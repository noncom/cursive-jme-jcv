# cursive-jcv

A demo Cursive project with example usage of JMonkeyEngine3 and JavaCV. All used copyrighted materials belong to their respective owners.

This demo initially demonstrates the problem of loading native libs for JavaCV FFmpegFrameGrabber. Launching from cursive yields an error. Launching with "lein repl" works as expected.
